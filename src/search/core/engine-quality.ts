// Slice S11b: per-engine snippet/source quality registry.
// Slice S11c: tier-to-weight mapping consumed by RRF fusion.
//
// WHY: the audit found that some engines (devdocs, lobsters) produce thin
// snippets ("Title — type", "12 score / 4 comments") while others
// (StackOverflow, Wikipedia, MDN) return rich evidence text. RRF currently
// treats them all uniformly via the static per-engine `weight`. S11c flips
// `qualityRrfMultiplier` to use the tier weights below so fusion is keyed
// by evidence quality, not just engine identity.
//
// Tier semantics: see EngineQualityTier doc in engine-base.ts.
//
// Three tiers (high / medium / low) instead of arbitrary floats:
//   - The audit's complaint was that every engine contributed equal RRF
//     weight, so a noisy low-recall adapter (Lobsters when it 400s, MDN on
//     a non-JS query) ranked alongside a high-recall first-party docs API.
//   - Three discrete tiers give an unambiguous knob to label engines
//     without bike-shedding decimal weights per-engine.
//   - The mapping is monotonic: high > medium > low, so a high-tier engine's
//     rank-1 result outranks a low-tier engine's rank-1 result even with a
//     small RRF window (k=60).

/**
 * Static per-engine quality tier. Engine name keys match the `name` field on

 * `medium` so unknown / plugin engines do not crash the registered-engines
 * test.
 *
 * Notes on individual tiers:
 *  - wikipedia / mdn / stackoverflow: structured JSON APIs with reliable
 *    summary/body fields → high.
 *  - bing / duckduckgo / bing_news: HTML scrapers, snippets are
 *    usable but vary (sometimes only a date prefix) → medium.
 *  - brave: API JSON with `description`, but the description is often a
 *    one-liner and the source list is narrower → medium.
 *  - hn-algolia: structured JSON but the snippet falls back to
 *    "N points · N comments" when no story text exists → medium.
 *  - lobsters: same fallback pattern as HN and the description is
 *    consistently sparse → low.
 *  - github-code: structured JSON but the snippet is the repository
 *    description or the file path — useful for ranking but rarely
 *    quotable evidence → medium.
 *  - devdocs: static slug lookup, snippet is just "Title — type" → low.
 *  - arxiv / semantic-scholar: structured paper APIs with abstracts when
 *    present, but `abstract` is frequently missing on S2 → medium.
